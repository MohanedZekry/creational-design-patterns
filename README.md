## Singleton
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to that instance.
In this project, we'll create a Singleton class called `Singleton`

## Factory
Factory pattern: This pattern allows you to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client. It is useful when you want to create different types of objects based on some criteria it provides an interface for creating objects, but it allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
